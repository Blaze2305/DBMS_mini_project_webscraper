        "Description": "This book, now in its fourth edition, is the second in a series of three books that teach the fundamentals of embedded systems as applied to ARM\u00ae Cortex\u2122-M microcontrollers. The three books are primarily written for undergraduate electrical and computer engineering students. They could also be used for professionals learning the ARM platform. The first book Embedded Systems: Introduction to ARM\u00ae Cortex\u2122-M Microcontrollers is an introduction to computers and interfacing focusing on assembly language and C programming. This second book focuses on interfacing and the design of embedded systems. The third book Embedded Systems: Real-Time Operating Systems for ARM\u00ae Cortex\u2122-M Microcontrollers is an advanced book focusing on operating systems, high-speed interfacing, control systems, and robotics.   \nAn embedded system is a system that performs a specific task and has a computer embedded inside. Topics include microcontrollers, design, verification, hardware/software synchronization, interfacing devices to the computer, timing diagrams, real-time systems, data collection and processing, motor control, analog filters, digital filters, and real-time signal processing.\nIn general, the area of embedded systems is an important and growing discipline within electrical and computer engineering. The educational market of embedded system is dominated by simple microcontrollers like the PIC, 9S12, and 8051. This is because of their market share, low cost, and historical dominance. However, as problems become more complex, so must the systems that solve them. A number of embedded system paradigms must shift in order to accommodate this growth in complexity. First, the number of calculations per second will increase from about 1 million/sec to 1 billion/sec. Similarly, the number of lines of software code will also increase from 1000\u2019s to 10 to 100 million. Thirdly, systems will involve multiple microcontrollers supporting many simultaneous operations. Lastly, the need for system verification will continue to grow as these systems are deployed into safety critical applications. These changes are more than a simple growth in size and bandwidth. These systems must employ parallel programming, DMA synchronization, real-time operating systems, fault tolerant design, priority interrupt handling, and networking. Consequently, it will be important to provide our students with these types of design experiences. The ARM platform is both low cost and provides the high performance features required in future embedded systems. The ARM market share is currently large and growing. Furthermore, students trained on the ARM will be equipped to design systems across the complete spectrum from simple to complex. The purpose of writing this book at this time is to bring engineering education into the 21st century.\nThis book employs many approaches to learning. It will not include an exhaustive recapitulation of the information in data sheets. First, it begins with basic fundamentals, which allows the reader to solve new problems with new technology. Second, the book presents many detailed design examples. These examples illustrate the process of design. There are multiple structural components that assist learning. Checkpoints, with answers in the back, are short easy to answer questions providing immediate feedback while reading. Simple homework, with answers to the odd questions on the web, provide more detailed learning opportunities. The book includes an index and a glossary so that information can be searched. The most important learning experience in a class like this are of course the laboratories. Each chapter has suggested lab assignments. More detailed lab descriptions are available on the web.\nThe book will cover embedded systems for the ARM\u00ae Cortex\u2122-M with specific details on the LM3S811, LM3S1968,TM4C123 and TM4C1294.  Although the solutions are specific for the TI LM3S and TM4C, it will be possible to use this book for other ARM derivatives.",

It deals with the basic principles and concepts of digital electronics. It addresses all aspects of combinational logic and provides a detailed understanding of logic gates that are the basic components in the implementation of circuits used to perform functions and operations of Boolean algebra. Combinational logic circuits are characterized by outputs that depend only on the actual input values.\n \nEfficient techniques to derive logic equations are proposed together with methods of analysis and synthesis of combinational logic circuits.

While C++ is a complex and professional language, experience shows that beginning students can easily understand and use C++. C++ Programming: An Object-Oriented Approach uses a combination of thorough, well-ordered explanations and a strong visual framework to make programming concepts accessible to students. The authors stress incremental program development, wherein program analysis is followed by building a structure chart, constructing UML flow diagrams, writing algorithms, undertaking program design, and finally testing. This foundation, combined with a focus on the benefits of a consistent and well-documented programming style, prepares students to tackle the academic and professional programming challenges they will encounter down the road with confidence.",

The objective of this course is to enable students to have the much-needed foundation for advanced technical skill, leading to better problem-solving in their respective disciplines. Although the course is running in almost all the technical universities for decades, major changes in the syllabus have been observed due to the recent paradigm shift of computation which is more focused on huge data and internet-based technologies. Majority of the institute has been redefined their course content of advanced data structure to fit the current need and course material heavily relies on research papers because of nonavailability of the redefined text book advanced data structure. To the best of our knowledge well-known textbook on advanced data structure provides only partial coverage of the syllabus.\n \nThe book offers comprehensive coverage of the most essential topics, including:\nPart I details advancements on basic data structures, viz., cuckoo hashing, skip list, tango tree and Fibonacci heaps and index files.\nPart II details data structures of different evolving data domains like special data structures, temporal data structures, external memory data structures, distributed and streaming data structures.\nPart III elucidates the applications of these data structures on different areas of computer science viz, network, www, DBMS, cryptography, graphics to name a few. The concepts and techniques behind each data structure and their applications have been explained.\nEvery chapter includes a variety of Illustrative Problems pertaining to the data structure(s) detailed, a summary of the technical content of the chapter and a list of Review Questions, to reinforce the comprehension of the concepts.\nThe book could be used both as an introductory or an advanced-level textbook for the advanced undergraduate, graduate and research programmes which offer advanced data structures as a core or an elective course. While the book is primarily meant to serve as a course material for use in the classroom, it could be used as a starting point for the beginner researcher of a specific domain.",

In truth, there are many complexities that need careful explanation, which is just what  Learning the bash Shell  provides.\n \nIf you are new to shell programming, the book provides an excellent introduction, covering everything from the most basic to the most advanced features.  And if you've been writing shell scripts for years, it offers a great way to find out what the new shell offers.   Learning the bash Shell  is also full of practical examples of shell commands and programs that will make everyday use of Linux that much easier.  With this book, programmers will learn: \nHow to install bash as your login shell\n \nThe basics of interactive shell use, including UNIX file and directory structures, standard I/O, and background jobs\n \nCommand line editing, history substitution, and key bindings\nHow to customize your shell environment without programming\nThe nuts and bolts of basic shell programming, flow control structures, command-line options and typed variables\nProcess handling, from job control to processes, coroutines and subshells\nDebugging techniques, such as trace and verbose modes\nTechniques for implementing system-wide shell customization and features related to system security",

Richard Stevens\u2019 Advanced Programming in the UNIX\u00ae Environment . Now, once again, Rich\u2019s colleague Steve Rago has thoroughly updated this classic work. The new third edition supports today\u2019s leading platforms, reflects new technical advances and best practices, and aligns with Version 4 of the Single UNIX Specification.\nSteve carefully retains the spirit and approach that have made this book so valuable. Building on Rich\u2019s pioneering work, he begins with files, directories, and processes, carefully laying the groundwork for more advanced techniques, such as signal handling and terminal I/O. He also thoroughly covers threads and multithreaded programming, and socket-based IPC.\nThis edition covers more than seventy new interfaces, including POSIX asynchronous I/O, spin locks, barriers, and POSIX semaphores. Most obsolete interfaces have been removed, except for a few that are ubiquitous. Nearly all examples have been tested on four modern platforms: Solaris 10, Mac OS X version 10.6.8 (Darwin 10.8.0), FreeBSD 8.0, and Ubuntu version 12.04 (based on Linux 3.2).\nAs in previous editions, you\u2019ll learn through examples, including more than ten thousand lines of downloadable, ISO C source code. More than four hundred system calls and functions are demonstrated with concise, complete programs that clearly illustrate their usage, arguments, and return values. To tie together what you\u2019ve learned, the book presents several chapter-length case studies, each reflecting contemporary environments.\nAdvanced Programming in the UNIX\u00ae Environment has helped generations of programmers write code with exceptional power, performance, and reliability. Now updated for today\u2019s systems, this third edition will be even more valuable.",

The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.\n\r\nThe first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called \u201cDivide-and-Conquer\u201d), and an appendix on matrices. It features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks.

        "Description": "This book covers both classical and modern models in deep learning. The primary focus is on the theory and algorithms of deep learning. The theory and algorithms of neural networks are particularly important for understanding important concepts, so that one can understand the important design concepts of neural architectures in different applications. Why do neural networks work? When do they work better than off-the-shelf machine-learning models? When is depth useful? Why is training neural networks so hard? What are the pitfalls?\nThe book is also rich in discussing different applications in order to give the practitioner a flavor of how neural architectures are designed for different types of problems. Applications associated with many different areas like recommender systems, machine translation, image captioning, image classification, reinforcement-learning based gaming, and text analytics are covered.\nThe chapters of this book span three categories:\nThe basics of neural networks:\n Many traditional machine learning models can be understood as special cases of neural networks. An emphasis is placed in the first two chapters on understanding the relationship between traditional machine learning and neural networks. Support vector machines, linear/logistic regression, singular value decomposition, matrix factorization, and recommender systems are shown to be special cases of neural networks. These methods are studied together with recent feature engineering methods like word2vec.\nFundamentals of neural networks:\n A detailed discussion of training and regularization is provided in Chapters 3 and 4. Chapters 5 and 6 present radial-basis function (RBF) networks and restricted Boltzmann machines.\nAdvanced topics in neural networks:\n Chapters 7 and 8 discuss recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Several advanced topics like deep reinforcement learning, neural Turing machines, Kohonen self-organizing maps, and generative adversarial networks are introduced in Chapters 9 and 10.\nThe book is written for graduate students, researchers, and practitioners. Numerous exercises are available along with a solution manual to aid in classroom teaching. Where possible, an application-centric view is highlighted in order to provide an understanding of the practical uses of each class of techniques.",

Both mechanical and architectural projects are introduced to capture the interest of more students and to offer a broader appeal.\n\n\n\r\nThe CAD portion of the text incorporates drafting theory whenever possible and covers the basics of drawing setup (units, limits, and layers), the tools of the Draw, Modify, and Dimension toolbars, and the fundamentals of 3D modeling. By focusing on the fundamental building blocks of CAD, Technical Drawing 101 provides a solid foundation for students going on to learn advanced CAD concepts and techniques (paper space, viewports, xrefs, annotative scaling, etc.) in intermediate CAD courses.\n\n\n\r\nIn recognition of the diverse career interests of our students, Technical Drawing 101 includes projects in which students create working drawings for a mechanical assembly as well as for an architectural project. We include architectural drawing because our experience has shown that many (if not most) first-semester drafting students are interested in careers in the architectural design field, and that a traditional technical drawing text, which focuses solely on mechanical drawing projects, holds little interest for these students.

This book provides balanced coverage of CAD/CAM (with slightly more emphasis on CAD topics) and bonus coverage of computer-aided engineering (CAE). This book's emphasis on the integration of three related disciplines-CAD, CAM, and CAE-makes it a great theoretical introduction to all subjects from geometric representation to the most sophisticated CAE subjects. Many illustrations and references ground the theory in practical examples.   The book also features a unique illustration of the whole product development process through a practical case study that gives readers a clear idea how CAD, CAM, and CAE systems are integrated to accelerate the product development process.   This book is carefully targeted toward today's students; topics are introduced in a concise, efficient manner, with mathematical terminology that is kept to a minimum. A background in programming, calculus, and matrix and vector algebra is helpful when using this text.",

It discusses the advent of smart grids and selected technical implications; further, by combining the perspectives of researchers from Europe and South America, the book captures the status quo of and approaches to smart grids in a wide range of countries. It describes the basic concepts, enabling readers to understand the theoretical aspects behind smart grid formation, while also examining current challenges and philosophical discussions.\n Like the industrial revolution and the birth of the Internet, smart grids are certain to change the way people use electricity. In this regard, a new term \u2013 the \u201cprosumer\u201d \u2013 is used to describe consumers who may sometimes also be energy producers. This is particularly appealing if we bear in mind that most of the distributed power generation in smart grids does not involve carbon emissions. \nAt first glance, the option of generating their own power could move consumers to leave their current energy provider. Yet the authors argue that doing so is not a wise choice: utilities will play a central role in this new scenario and should not be ignored.",

There has long been a need for a comprehensive text on fluid power systems, written from an engineering perspective, which is suitable for an undergraduate-level course in fluid power.Fluid Power Circuits and Controls: Fundamentals and Applications encourages students to think of the collection of components as a system. The author illustrates each concept with a circuit diagram, and as each component is discussed, immediately places it in a circuit and analyzes its performance. This approach allows students to immediately apply what they have learned and encourages them to think about how the component operating characteristics interact with the rest of the circuit.Covering all aspects of the industry, this book:oDevelops  the basic concept for power delivery with fluidsoReviews basic concepts of fluid mechanics and discusses the key properties of the fluidsoDiscusses the creation and control of flow and the various methods used to control pressure in a circuitoProvides a detailed example of the classic problem of hydrostatic transmission designoPresents characteristics of auxiliary components and applicable SAE standardsoAddresses pneumatics, focusing on the difference in power transmission for liquid and gasoDiscusses servo valves and proportional valves without requiring a background in automatic controlsThe text is richly illustrated, filled with fully worked example problems, and reinforced with exercises in each chapter. Fluid Power Circuits and Controls offers valuable design experience and the background its readers need to approach real-world fluid power problems with confidence.",

        "Description": "If you have programming experience and a familiarity with C--the dominant language in embedded systems--Programming Embedded Systems, Second Edition is exactly what you need to get started with embedded software. This software is ubiquitous, hidden away inside our watches, DVD players, mobile phones, anti-lock brakes, and even a few toasters. The military uses embedded software to guide missiles, detect enemy aircraft, and pilot UAVs. Communication satellites, deep-space probes, and many medical instruments would have been nearly impossible to create without embedded software. The first edition of Programming Embedded Systems taught the subject to tens of thousands of people around the world and is now considered the bible of embedded programming. This second edition has been updated to cover all the latest hardware designs and development methodologies. The techniques and code examples presented here are directly applicable to real-world embedded software projects of all sorts. Examples use the free GNU software programming tools, the eCos and Linux operating systems, and a low-cost hardware platform specially developed for this book. If you obtain these tools along with Programming Embedded Systems, Second Edition, you'll have a full environment for exploring embedded systems in depth. But even if you work with different hardware and software, the principles covered in this book apply. Whether you are new to embedded systems or have done embedded work before, you'll benefit from the topics in this book, which include:How building and loading programs differ from desktop or server computers Basic debugging techniques--a critical skill when working with minimally endowed embedded systems Handling different types of memory Interrupts, and the monitoring and control of on-chip and external peripherals Determining whether you have real-time requirements, and whether your operating system and application can meet those requirements Task synchronization with real-time operating systems and embedded Linux Optimizing embedded software for size, speed, and power consumption Working examples for eCos and embedded Linux  So whether you're writing your first embedded program, designing the latest generation of hand-held whatchamacalits, or managing the people who do, this book is for you. Programming Embedded Systems will help you develop the knowledge and skills you need to achieve proficiency with embedded software. Praise for the first edition: \"This lively and readable book is the perfect introduction for those venturing into embedded systems software development for the first time. It provides in one place all the important topics necessary to orient programmers to the embedded development process. --Lindsey Vereen, Editor-in-Chief, Embedded Systems Programming",
